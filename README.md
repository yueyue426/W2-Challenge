# Portfolio Page Project

## Overview

Welcome to my Portfolio Page Project! As part of a coding boot camp challenge, this project was developed from scratch to showcase my web development skills and projects. A portfolio is a key tool in a developer's career search, demonstrating not just the outcomes of their projects but also the thought processes behind them. This portfolio page is designed to be a living document, evolving with my skills and projects.

## Features
Responsive Design: Utilizes flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables to ensure the portfolio is accessible on devices of all sizes.
Dynamic Content: Features sections for "About Me," "Work," and "Contact" that provide insight into my background, showcase my projects, and offer ways to get in touch.
Interactive Elements: Navigation links that smoothly scroll to corresponding sections for a seamless user experience.
Highlighted Projects: Displays my web applications with an emphasis on the first application, showcasing my strongest work.
User Story

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

No installation is required. The portfolio is a web-based application accessible through any modern web browser.
