# Portfolio Page Project

## Overview

Welcome to my Portfolio Page Project! As part of a coding boot camp challenge, this project was developed from scratch to showcase my web development skills and projects. A portfolio is a key tool in a developer's career search, demonstrating not just the outcomes of their projects but also the thought processes behind them. This portfolio page is designed to be a living document, evolving with my skills and projects.

## Features
Responsive Design: Utilizes flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables to ensure the portfolio is accessible on devices of all sizes.
Dynamic Content: Features sections for "About Me," "Work," and "Contact" that provide insight into my background, showcase my projects, and offer ways to get in touch.
Interactive Elements: Navigation links that smoothly scroll to corresponding sections for a seamless user experience.
Highlighted Projects: Displays my web applications with an emphasis on the first application, showcasing my strongest work.
User Story

## User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

The portfolio presents the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
Navigation links scroll to the corresponding section.
The section about the developer's work displays titled images of the applications, with the first application's image being larger in size.
Clicking on the images of the applications takes the user to that deployed application.
The layout is responsive, adapting to various screens and devices.
Installation

No installation is required. The portfolio is a web-based application accessible through any modern web browser.
